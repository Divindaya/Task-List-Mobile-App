"# Task-List-Mobile-App" 

Coded using React Native, this task list application works on both Android and iPhone mobile phones.

The user taps the "Add New Goal" button at the top of the screen which triggers a modal screen to come up.
On the second screen, the user is able to write out the task, and either save the task or cancel the action using appropriate buttons. 
If saved, the application returns to the first screen with the newly added task added to the bottom of the list.
If the user chooses to cancel the task, the user is returned to the first screen and the written out task is discarded.
The user is able to delete saved tasks by pressing on the particular task.
